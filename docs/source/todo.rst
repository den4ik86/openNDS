TODO List
#########

Features should be aimed at providing tools to allow openNDS to be used as flexible Captive Portal engine, rather than building in specific solutions.

Here is a list of things that should be done soon:

* Add support for definable language lookup files for otherwise hard coded text eg http error codes

Here is a list of possible things TO DO

* Consider providing an openNDS-mini package for OpenWrt - for legacy devices with very restricted resources.
* ip version 6 is not currently supported by NDS. It is not essential or advantageous to have in the short term but should be added at some time in the future.
