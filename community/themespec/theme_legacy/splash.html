Content:
	This is the legacy splash page (splash.html) that used the deprecated NDS template system.
	The template system was replaced by ThemeSpec scripts.
	Only gatewayname, tok, redir and authaction template variables are supported
	#
	# The client is NOT required to accept a terms of service statement and does not receive any indication of a privacy policy.
	#
	# Use of this ThemeSpec may make you personally liable for misuse of the Internet connection and may not comply with your country or state regulations.
	# Use at your own risk at public venues.

	You may either embed css in this file or use a separate .css file, as demonstrated here.

	It should be noted when designing a custom splash page
	that for security reasons many CPD implementations:
		Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
		Prohibit the use of href links.
		Prohibit downloading of external files
			(including .css and .js).
		Prohibit the execution of javascript.
